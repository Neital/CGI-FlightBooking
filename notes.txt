So apparently everything was fine and the only issue was with me not understanding docker.
Here are the important steps:

docker exec -it flight_booking_db bash
psql -U flight_user -d flight_booking
\dt

result:
              List of relations
 Schema |     Name      | Type  |    Owner
--------+---------------+-------+-------------
 public | airport       | table | flight_user
 public | flight        | table | flight_user
 public | plane         | table | flight_user
 public | seat          | table | flight_user
 public | seat_features | table | flight_user
 public | seat_prices   | table | flight_user
 public | test_entity   | table | flight_user
(7 rows)

I should probably disable docker while I work on backend :^
